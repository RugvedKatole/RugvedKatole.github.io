# Hello There !
I am a Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University, working with Prof. Christopher Stewart to bridge computing and robotics for real-time robotic systems.

My current research focuses on generating datasets that capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of real-world environments, enabling robotic models to operate efficiently in harsh conditions while minimizing the costs of data collection and testing.

Additionally, I am developing sparse data reconstruction techniques, where UAVs partially scout crop fields to collect sensor data. This data is iteratively used to predict field-wide conditions, ensuring accuracy remains above a set threshold while optimizing resource usage.

If you are interested in collaboration please send me an email on **katole\<dot>2\<at>osu\<dot>edu**

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
