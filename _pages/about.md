# Hello There !
I am a Ph.D. aspirant actively looking for a Ph.D. positon. 
My research interests are in planning, control and decision-making for autonomous systems. The focus is on making provably safe algorithms which are able to handle the uncertainites of the world! 

I am currently a Research Assistant at [ARMS lab](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/) IIT bombay, where I am advised by [Prof. Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha). Here I have worked on Multi-agent patrolling, Intersection Mangement, and self-driving cars. 


I also work with [Prof. Christopher Stewart](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~stewart.962/) from Ohio State University on UAV scouting for crop health predictions. The UAV partially scouts crop fields for collection of sensor data. This data is then processed by a Deep Learning model to extract and health map. Based on this map a reinforcement learning algorithms decides the scouting trajectory. I am reposible for build the Deep learning model to make it happen with highest accuracy.

Refer to my [Projects Page](/projects) for more info.
