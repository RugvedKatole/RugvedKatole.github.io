Dear Professor,

I have been closely following the groundbreaking research conducted by the Kantor Lab, and I must express my admiration for the remarkable achievements in the field of agriculture, particularly the 'Vine Pruning' and 'Plant Stress Index' projects. The innovative approaches applied to monitor plant stress indicators are pivotal for optimizing resource management and maximizing yields.

My own research aligns closely with your interests, and I had the pleasure of presenting our work during the IROS 2023 agriculture robotics workshop, where you delivered an enlightening talk on dexterous manipulation in agriculture. Currently collaborating with Prof. Christopher Stewart, I am focused on developing a deep-learning model that can predict plant health by leveraging sparse data. The core concept is to exploit the correlations among various sensor data that collectively reflect the plant's health. For instance, water stress data informs about mesophyll structure, while the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from multi-spectral sensors provides insights into chlorophyll content. By understanding these correlations, we aim to create a model capable of efficiently scouting fields using multi-sensor data from a swarm of drones, as detailed in our workshop paper.

Having gained valuable exposure and skills through this research, I am eager to contribute to the impactful projects underway at Kantor Lab. The Vine Pruning and Plant Stress Index initiatives, given my background in the area, particularly captivate my interest. However, I am open to exploring other opportunities that align with my skills and expertise.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of collaborating with you and the Kantor Lab team to advance sustainable agricultural practices through the integration of robotics.

Looking forward to the opportunity.

Sincerely,
Rugved Katole
