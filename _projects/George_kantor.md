Dear Professor,

I have been following the research in Kantor Lab, and the heights you have achieved in agriculture are commendable. The 'Vine Pruning' and 'Plant Stress Index' projects have intrigued me the most. The plant stress indicators are necessary for the efficient management of resources and yield maximization. I have been working on something similar with Prof. Christopher Stewart, you might have visited our poster during the IROS 2023 agriculture robotics workshop where you gave a talk on dexterous manipulation in agriculture. I am working on developing a deep-learning model that can predict plant health from sparse data collected. The idea is that different sensor data comment on a common aspect of the plant,i.e., health and they are correlated. For instance, the water stress on the crop comments on the mesophyll structure of the plant, high water stress indicates lower levels of mesophyll cells which also limits the space for chloroplasts and reduces photosynthesis. On the other hand the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from multi-spectral sensor comments on the chlorophyll content of the crop. Less chlorophyll indicates low photosynthesis capability and hence lesser yield. Using this correlation the aim is to develop a model which will efficiently scout the field using multi-sensor data from a swarm of drones. A more detailed explanation can be found in our [workshop paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C60duNtm4XHOxmWbMldSNcFI-roEtM1z/view). 

I believe this exposure has equipped me with the tools and knowledge to contribute to the projects at Kantor Lab. The Vine Pruning and Plant Stress Index projects are of particular interest as I share a similar background in the area although I am open to other opportunities as well. 

I look forward to working with you and contributing more sustainable agricultural practices with robotics.
