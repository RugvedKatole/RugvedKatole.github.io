Dear Professor,

I came across your work addressing intersection management via [topological braids](https://chrismavrogiannis.com/pdfs/mavrogiannis2023abstracting.pdf) while exploring research on autonomous intersection management through a non-communicative approach. Your research sparked my interest, and I am eager to collaborate with you.

The ongoing research at the Fluent Robotics Lab, particularly focusing on human modeling for , captivates my attention. Considering the imminent future filled with automation and robots, understanding human-robot interactions and the safety constraints inherent in robotic systems is crucial. I am currently engaged in a project involving human-robot interaction modeling for autonomous overtaking.

In this [project](../overtaking), the objective is to execute overtaking maneuvers in the presence of oncoming traffic on a single-lane road. The intents of the human-drivers are perceived implicitly from their trajectory and the necessary control policy for robot is computed without deviating from the objective. I am developing an integrated model predictive planner capable of generating safe trajectories for such operations. The goal is to model a general sum game between vehicles such that the "rational" human trajectory is treated with confidence while overtaking. In cases of uncertainty, the vehicle will abort the overtaking maneuver, akin to the situation described in [Contingency Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05483) related to pedestrian crossing. In this scenario, the vehicle remains uncertain about the decision to overtake until the maneuver begins. As it progresses and enters a new lane, the vehicle detects the oncoming vehicle, prompting new information for a better decision on whether to proceed or abort. Further details on the problem can be found [here](../overtaking).

I believe that my experience aligns well with the goals of the Fluent Robotics Lab, and I am confident in my ability to make a significant contribution to research in this field.

I am excited about the prospect of working with you!

Yours Sincerely,

Rugved
