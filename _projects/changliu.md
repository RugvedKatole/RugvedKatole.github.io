Dear Professor,

I have been following your research and it has intrigued me more than anything majorly because I was able to connect the research with the work I have been doing here at IIT Bombay. Since then I have been diving deeper into the literature right from understanding the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi equations to modeling zero-sum and general sum games for human-robot interaction. I have been through your papers on safe Human-Robot collaboration, human motion prediction and autonomous vehicles. Your research has intrigued me to delve deeper into human-robot interaction and safe control synthesis. The paper titled 'Safe and Efficient Exploration of Human Models During Human-Robot Interaction' excited me the most as it deals with a very realistic scenario of imperfect human models, even we as humans are unaware of others' actions but we adapt to them based on our observation and similarly as this work improves the human model. This addresses a major issue of adapting to uncertainty in the human-robot interaction to synthesize a safe control.  This inspired me to pursue human-robot interaction and I have involved myself in an [autonomous overtaking](../overtaking) project involving human-robot interaction and safety-critical decision-making.

In this project, the aim is to make overtaking maneuvers in the presence of oncoming traffic on a single-lane road. It can be inferred that safety needs to be assured in such a scenario. I am developing an integrated model predictive planner that can generate safe trajectories for such an operation. As one of the possible solutions, I aim to model a general sum game between the vehicles and make confident decisions on overtaking and in case of uncertainty the vehicle shall abort the maneuver. The vehicle is uncertain about the decision to overtake until it starts overtaking, and as the maneuver proceeds and the vehicle starts entering a new lane it notices the oncoming vehicle (i.e. new information). Taking this new information into account the vehicle has to make an informed decision whether continuing the overtake is a safe maneuver or it shall abort. A human motion prediction plays a crucial role in this work assuming a human-in-isolation or an imperfect data-driven model will only lead to a conservative control since the vehicle might never try to overtake. An accurate model or a model continuously adapting to human behavior through observation can reduce conservativeness by modeling confidence into the predicted motion and taking calculated risks.

I have familiarized myself with the concepts of safety and HRI, for reference some of the papers I referred to are listed below.

- [Multimodal Safe Control for Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11898)
- [Towards Proactive Safe Human-Robot Collaborations via Data-Efficient Conditional Behavior Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11893)
- [An Optimal Control Framework for Influencing Human Driving Behavior in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13456)
- [Safe and efficient exploration of human models during human-robot interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01103)
- [Contingency Games for Multi-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05483)

I look forward to working with you and contributing theoretically and practically to the research in safe Human-Robot Interactions.
