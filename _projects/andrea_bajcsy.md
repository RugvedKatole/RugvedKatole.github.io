Dear Professor,

I have been following your research and it has intrigued and motivated me to puruse Ph.D. in this direction.

I have read the following papers:

- [An Efficient Reachability-Based Framework for Provably Safe Autonomous Navigation in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00532)
- [A Robust Control Framework for Human Motion Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9210199)
- [Analyzing Human Models that Adapt Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05746)
- [Safety Assurances for Human-Robot Interaction via Confidence-aware Game-theoretic Human Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14700)
- [Contingency Games for Multi-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05483)
