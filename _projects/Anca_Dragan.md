Dear Professor,

I have been following your research and it has intrigued me more than anything majorly because I was able to connect the research with the work I have been doing here at IIT Bombay. Since then I have been diving deeper into the literature right from understanding the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi equations to modeling zero-sum and general sum games for human-robot interaction. Your paper on [safety assurances for human-robot interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14700) intrigued me the most. This paper sowed the seeds of inspiration for me to work on safety-assuring problems. With this inspiration I have involved myself in [autonomous overtaking](../overtaking) project where safety is an inherent requirement. 

In this project, the aim is to make overtaking maneuvers in the presence of oncoming traffic on a single-lane road. As it can be inferred that safety needs to be assured in such a scenario. I am developing an integrated model predictive planner that can generate safe trajectories for such an operation. I aim to model a general sum game between the vehicles and make confident decisions on overtaking and in case of uncertainty the vehicle shall abort the vehicle. This is a similar situation to the pedestrian crossing as given in your work on [Contingency Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05483). Here the vehicle is uncertain about the decision to overtake until it starts overtaking, and as the maneuver procceds and the vehicle starts entering new lane it notices the oncoming vehicle (i.e. new information). Taking this new information into account the vehicle can take an informed decision wheather if continuing the overtake is safe maneuver or it shall abort. 

I have familarized myself with the concepts in safety and HRI, for reference I have referred to following papers to get started.

- [A Time-Dependent Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi Formulation of Reachable Sets for Continuous Dynamic Games](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.851439)
- [Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability: A Brief Overview and Recent Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07523)
- [On Infusing Reachability-Based Safety Assurance within Planning Frameworks for Human-Robot Vehicle Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03390)
- [Differential Games I by Rufus Issacs](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM1391.pdf)
- [Safety Assurances for Human-Robot Interaction via Confidence-aware Game-theoretic Human Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14700)
- [Contingency Games for Multi-Agent Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05483)

I look forward to work with you and contribute theoretically and practically to the research in safe Human Robot Interactions.
