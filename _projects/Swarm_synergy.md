Swarm robotics constitutes a field dedicated to orchestrating multiple autonomous agents for diverse tasks, ranging from search and rescue to exploration and surveillance. This approach takes inspiration from the collective behaviors observed in biological entities such as bees and ants. The work delves into a scenario where swarm robots strive to form communities without explicit communication, a feature particularly relevant in environments lacking communication channels, such as underwater or space.

The primary objective is to achieve swarm synergy, wherein each robot silently endeavors to form a community without awareness of others. This communication-free methodology holds promise for applications in military operations, enhancing adaptability and operational security. The proposed algorithm enables robots to autonomously organize based on sensed information, with a specific emphasis on community formation without predefined parameters. The contributions encompass introducing the novel concept of swarm synergy, crafting an algorithm for silent community formation, and emphasizing features like untraceability.

The impetus for this research stems from the potential strategic advantages, especially in military contexts where untraceability proves paramount. The algorithm's flexibility, independent of community size and specific members, is underscored, supported by analytical, simulation, and experimental results. The paper not only introduces a distinctive application within swarm robotics but also presents an algorithm whose features contribute to the advancement of the field.
